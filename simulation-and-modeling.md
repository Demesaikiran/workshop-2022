## Graphics, Modeling, Simulation

-   So far we've only dealt with hardware.
-   But buying and assembling hardware is difficult and expensive when you don't know what's going to work.
-   Just like we can visualize what kind of hardware components will fit together, we should be able to do that in a computer environment.
-   The solution is *simulation*.
-   We *model* our hardware in a simulator.
-   Give the necessary commands, and can see how it'll react.

## Autonomous agents

-   Small experiments with MuJoCo and Gym
    -   Gym <https://github.com/openai/gym> is deprecated now and the fork Gymnasium is currently being maintained <https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium>
-   Integrating RL agents
-   Environments in MuJoCo
-   Training a pendulum
